3. Input data:
  - The app will prompt you to enter a YouTube channel ID. Enter the channel ID(or multiple IDS with separator ', ') and press Enter. 
  - After that, app will ask you what amount of previous days to fetch data from, imput number and press Enter. 
  - The app will then fetch the channel(s) data and store it in a `channel_data.json` file.
 
 Note: you can use [Comment Picker YouTube Channel ID](https://commentpicker.com/youtube-channel-id.php) to easly get IDs of your channels.

4. To view the scraped data, open the `channel_data.json` file in your preferred text editor or JSON viewer.

Note: If you want to add more channels to the `channel_data.json` file, simply run the app again and enter a different channel ID. The app will update the `channel_data.json` file with the new data without overwriting the existing data.
